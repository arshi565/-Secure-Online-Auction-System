# -Secure-Online-Auction-System
The system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented
with the following modules and roles. The modules involved are:
 Seller module: In this module, the seller will post the product
information in which he/she wants to sell or auction the product
through online. In this module the seller can post the image of the
product by using capture image and all the necessary information
about the product such as the product name, its description and the
auction date and time at what the product is going to be auctioned
and finally the stop time of the auction. 
Buyer module: In this module, the bidder will first see which
product is been posted on the app which is to be auctioned. The
bidder/buyer will see all the information about the product. If the
bidder is interested to buy that product then he can register for the
auctioning and bid the amount. At last, at the end of the auctioning
the bidder will get to know the result. Last when the number of
auction has been created the bidder will decide the amount which
product to be auction. The bidder has to auction within a time which
is set by the seller while creating auction that is one hour, twentyfour hours, etc. 
Admin module: The admin can manage the users and view the
information about each item on the system. If the item was sold or
reached its ending time, it will be removed from the data-base.
